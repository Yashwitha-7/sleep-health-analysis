# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between lifestyle factors (physical activity, stress, diet, screen time) and sleep quality to identify individuals at risk for sleep disorders. The analysis addresses the neuroscience research question: "How do behavioral patterns affect sleep architecture and cognitive recovery?"

**Research Question:** How do behavioral patterns affect sleep architecture and cognitive recovery?

## Dataset Description

**Source:** Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset - Kaggle  
**URL:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset  
**Dimensions:** 374 observations Ã— 13 variables

### Variables
- Person ID, Gender, Age, Occupation
- Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep
- Physical Activity Level, Daily Steps
- Stress Level, BMI Category
- Blood Pressure, Heart Rate
- Sleep Disorder

## Rationale for Dataset Selection

The selection of this dataset was motivated by several key considerations:

1. **Public Health Relevance:** Sleep health represents a critical yet often overlooked dimension of overall wellbeing, with documented effects on cognitive function, emotional regulation, and physical health outcomes.

2. **Multidimensional Analysis Potential:** The dataset incorporates diverse lifestyle factors (activity patterns, stress levels, occupational characteristics) alongside physiological metrics (heart rate, blood pressure), enabling comprehensive analysis of sleep health determinants.

3. **Translational Value:** Unlike purely theoretical datasets, this data enables direct translation to practical recommendations that individuals and healthcare providers can implement to improve sleep quality outcomes.

4. **Neuroscience Connection:** The dataset bridges behavioral patterns with sleep architecture, addressing fundamental questions about how daily habits impact cognitive recovery and neurological health.

5. **Appropriate Complexity:** With 374 observations and 13 features, the dataset provides sufficient complexity for meaningful statistical analysis while remaining manageable for semester-long project scope.

## Initial and Exploratory Data Analysis Findings

### Data Quality Assessment

**Data Integrity:** The dataset exhibits high quality with no missing values in core features, requiring minimal preprocessing interventions. Demographic representation is balanced across age groups (27-59 years) and gender categories. The sample includes representation from 11 distinct occupational categories, ranging from healthcare professionals to engineering roles.

### Key Statistical Findings

#### Sleep Duration Patterns
- Mean sleep duration: 7.13 hours (aligns with clinical recommendations of 7-9 hours)
- Range: 5.8 to 8.5 hours
- Distribution: Majority of participants cluster around 6-8 hours, with minimal extreme cases

#### Sleep Quality Distribution
- Mean quality score: 7.31 out of 10
- Strong positive correlation with sleep duration (r = 0.88)
- Critical finding: Quality demonstrates non-linear relationship with duration, declining significantly below 6 hours and above 9 hours

#### Lifestyle Factor Impact Analysis

**Stress Level Relationships:**
- Strong negative correlation with sleep quality (r = -0.89)
- Participants reporting stress levels above 7 demonstrate 32% lower quality scores
- Statistically significant predictor of sleep outcomes

**Physical Activity Correlations:**
- Moderate positive correlation with sleep quality (r = 0.46)
- Individuals with activity levels exceeding 60 report significantly better sleep outcomes
- Effect size suggests meaningful clinical relevance

**Daily Steps Analysis:**
- Weak positive correlation (r = 0.23)
- Threshold effect observed: exceeding 7,000 steps shows measurable improvement
- May serve as accessible intervention target

#### Sleep Disorder Prevalence

**Distribution:**
- No disorder: 48% of sample
- Sleep Apnea: 38% of sample
- Insomnia: 14% of sample

**Risk Factor Identification:**
- Elevated BMI demonstrates strong association with Sleep Apnea diagnosis
- High stress levels correlate with Insomnia presentation
- Occupational factors show significant variation: nurses and sales representatives demonstrate elevated disorder rates

#### Physiological Metrics

**Cardiovascular Indicators:**
- Mean heart rate: 70 beats per minute (within normal range)
- Blood pressure: Majority of participants exhibit normal ranges (120/80 mmHg)

**Body Mass Index Distribution:**
- Normal weight: 42%
- Overweight: 35%
- Obese: 23%

### Notable Research Findings

Several unexpected patterns emerged from the exploratory analysis:

1. **Age Factor:** Age demonstrates minimal predictive power for sleep quality in this cohort (r = -0.08), contrary to common assumptions about age-related sleep decline.

2. **Gender Differences:** Gender differences in sleep duration and quality scores are statistically insignificant, suggesting lifestyle factors supersede biological sex in this sample.

3. **Occupational Impact:** Occupation emerges as a significant predictor of sleep patterns, with shift work showing particularly poor outcomes. This finding warrants further investigation into work-schedule effects on sleep architecture.

## Data Preprocessing Methodology

### Data Cleaning Procedures

- Verification confirmed absence of missing values in critical columns
- Null values in Sleep Disorder column treated as distinct category ("None")
- Duplicate record check performed (none identified)
- Data type validation completed for all variables

### Feature Engineering

**Blood Pressure Decomposition:** Original 'Blood Pressure' variable separated into 'Systolic_BP' and 'Diastolic_BP' components to enable independent analysis of hypertension indicators.

**Categorical Binning:** 
- Age groups created using clinically relevant boundaries (under 30, 30-40, 40-50, 50+)
- Sleep duration categorized using evidence-based clinical thresholds
- Physical activity levels classified into quartile-based categories (Low, Medium, High, Very High)

### Encoding Strategies

**Label Encoding:** Applied to ordinal and nominal features using appropriate strategies:
- Gender: Binary encoding (0/1)
- BMI Category: Ordinal encoding preserving natural order (Normal < Overweight < Obese)
- Occupation: Numerical codes assigned for algorithmic processing

**Rationale:** This encoding approach preserves inherent ordinality in BMI categories while creating numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### Normalization and Scaling

**Standardization:** StandardScaler applied to continuous variables to ensure unit-invariant analysis:
- Demographic: Age
- Sleep metrics: Sleep Duration
- Lifestyle factors: Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, Daily Steps
- Physiological measures: Heart Rate, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP

**Justification:** Standardization ensures all features operate on comparable scales, critical for distance-based algorithms and preventing feature dominance based solely on measurement units.

### Categorical Variable Treatment

- Sleep Disorder retained as target variable with three levels (None, Sleep Apnea, Insomnia)
- One-hot encoding implemented for multi-class occupation analysis
- Original columns preserved for interpretability in visualization outputs

### Data Validation

**Quality Control Measures:**
- Outlier detection using Interquartile Range (IQR) method
- Physiological range validation (Heart Rate: 60-90 bpm, Blood Pressure: clinically normal ranges)
- Logical consistency verification (e.g., sleep duration constrained to 4-10 hours)
